## File Explanation 
* .gitignore - This file is used to ignore directories or files when pushing/ committing changes. In this case we are ignoring node modules that have been installed for the website. 

* gulpfile.js - This file is used by Gulp which is a JavaScript toolkit for front-end development. In this case we are using this to compile our .scss files and for browsersync. Browsersync allows you to refresh/ reload your webpage immediately when you change your code so you don't have to refresh the page every time. 

* package.json/ package-lock.json - These files describe what dependencies and modules that the website uses. For this website we are using bootstrap (v. 4.4.1), jquery (v. 3.4.1), popper.js (v. 1.16.0), and scrollreveal (v. 4.0.5).

* /src/assets - Here you can find pictures/ wallpaper used in the website. 

* /src/scss - Here you can the scss and css files that were used to style each page on the website.

* /src/.html - There are 4 html files here:
  * index.html - This is the homepage that users will first see.
  * about.html - This is an "about me" page where users can learn more about me, but don't trust everything you read on the internet.
  * projects.html - To be honest I haven't done very many projects so I decided to put some hobbies I have in there instead.
  * contact.html - In this I have some contact information where you can find me. Note: I don't really use twitter and I don't post a lot on instagram
